CSI format

A CSI file is a text file, containing a series of lines. 

A line beginning with '%' is a comment line and is ignored for training.

Other lines are of the form:

  id:String <TAB> T:String <TAB> H:String <TAB> L:String

Strings are not permitted to contain embedded <TAB>s. 

The processor must recognize the labels (L) entailment, contradiction,
neutral, or -. (The last is understood as "ambiguous".) The label may
also be empty (unknwown). 

Label files

Note that there is sometimes a need to process separate label
files. These files are also text files with non-comment lines of the
form:

  id:String <TAB> L: String

Flat files

Sometimes there is a need to flatten out a CSI file. The flattened
version of a CSI file can be thought of as being obtained by replacing
<TAB>s with '\n'.
